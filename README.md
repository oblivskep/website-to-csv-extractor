# 🌐 Website → CSV Data Extractor (Python)

> Extract structured data from public websites and deliver it as clean CSV/Excel files.

This small Python tool uses a simple configuration file to collect repeating items (titles, prices, links, etc.) from a webpage and export them into `output.csv`.

Change the config → run the script → get a spreadsheet.

## 🧩 What this is for

- Product listings
- Directories
- Catalogs
- Search results
- Any page with repeating items

You provide a URL and the fields you want. The script does the rest.
